# Hello! 👋 
This project was built to practice Python, AI logic, and memory systems  
A simple experimental AI bot written in Python that can memorize user information and respond dynamically.
### 🧠 Opportunities

• Memorizing words by command to remember  
• Saving memory after restarting  
• Remembers:  
• Name  
• Age  
• Mood  
• Reacts to greeting and farewell  


### 💡 Purpose of the project
Study of memory logic, data storage and AI behavior.


# ⚠️ Status  

***The project is under development, the code is experimental🚨🚨🚨***


## Tech Stack
# Python  
# re (Regular Expressions)  
***since the project is not finished and it will be improved in the future, a technology stack will appear here, but for now, there is nothing here. (import re) was used from the libraries***



``
## Installation
1. Download the project
2. Open the folder
3. Run `python main.py`

*PS: This code was written by me to understand AI and memory management.*  
*It was written during my practical training, and new library functions will be added in the future.*
