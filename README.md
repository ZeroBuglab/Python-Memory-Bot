# Hello! 👋
## I'm a beginner Python developer

### 🧠 Opportunities

• Memorizing words by command to remember  
• Saving memory after restarting  
• Remembers:  
• Name  
• Age  
• Mood  
• Reacts to greeting and farewell  


#### 💡 Purpose of the project
Study of memory logic, data storage and AI behavior.


##### ⚠️ Status  

***The project is under development, the code is experimental🚨🚨🚨***

##### Stack  

*since the project is not finished and it will be improved in the future, a technology stack will appear here, but for now, there is nothing here. (import re) was used from the libraries



# **installation and launch instructions**  
the code itself is not that complicated.  
The AI accepts each word specified in the (responses,intentions)  
variable, and it can also remember words if you write (remember) before saying something.  

*PS: This code was written by me to understand AI and memory management.*  
*It was written during my practical training, and new library functions will be added in the future.*
