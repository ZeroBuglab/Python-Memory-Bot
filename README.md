# Hello! 👋 
******************
This project was built to practice Python, AI logic, and memory systems  
A simple experimental AI bot written in Python that can memorize user information and respond dynamically.

### 🧠 Opportunities

• Memorizing words by command to remember  
• Saving memory after restarting  
• Remembers:  
• Name  
• Age  
• Mood  
• Reacts to greeting and farewell  

____________________________
### 💡 Purpose of the project
Study of memory logic, data storage and AI behavior.

# ⚠️ Status  
***The project is under development, the code is experimental🚨🚨🚨***

_____________________________
## Tech Stack
- Python
- re (Regular Expressions)    
***since the project is not finished and it will be improved in the future, a technology stack will appear here, but for now, there is nothing here. (import re) was used from the libraries***

________________________
## Installation
1. Download the project
2. Open the folder
3. Run `python main.py`

## Example Usage
you: привет  
Ai: Привет! Рад тебя видеть 😊  
you: сколько мне лет    
AI: Хорошо, скажи — сколько тебе лет?    
you: 25  
Ai: Отлично, запомнил!
